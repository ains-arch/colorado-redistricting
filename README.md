# Intro
Ensemble analysis of Colorado's congressional districting plan based on data from 2018 midterm
elections. Colorado had 7 US House districts in 2018.

Due to availability of data, this ensemble analysis focuses on
1. the US House map in 2018 compiled by MGGG
    1. 2018 Colorado precinct shapefile from Todd Bleess of the Colorado State Demographer's Office
    1. election data from the Colorado Secretary of State's Office
    1. 2010 Decennial Census demographic data
1. information about the 2012 redistricting processes from Ballotpedia

# Background
## How many districts?
7 congressional seats, made up of Census enumeration districts

## Who draws them?
* Colorado General Assembly
* committee comprised of members of both chambers with equal split in party membership
* With staff members, it was a 5-5-1 R-D-I split.
* Governor of Colorado (Democrat John Hickenlooper) had veto power over the bills
* Ultimately, because the Assembly failed to pass a map by the deadline, the redistricting process
went to court.

## Legal challenges?
The redistricting process in the legislative session was a mess that failed to reach any common
ground on maps by Sine Die. Both major parties filed suit, as well as the Colorado Hispanic Bar
Association and Colorado Latino Forum. Cases were consolidated, deadlines for maps from the major
parties and other groups on the lawsuit were set. The court considered a half dozen maps and
approved the Moreno/South Democratic map, praising it for maximizing competitiveness, current
communities of interest, and "the real possibility that voters will be as engaged in the electoral
process as possible."

Republicans filed an appeal, but the ruling was upheld in the state Supreme Court, dismissing the
argument that the map was bad because it cut up too many counties into multiple districts. The final
map created three competitive Congressional races. Legislative reform was proposed after the
redistricting process was completed.

## Redrawing of lines recently?
The lines have since been redrawn after the 2020 census to reflect Colorado's new eighth
representative.
