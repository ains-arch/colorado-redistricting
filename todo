proof of mixing through something other than cutedges
- look at factors you're interested in

use state-wide elections not house data as a proxy for voter partisanship
- explain it's because uncontested/weak challenges
- this is why beth used the state treasurer's race

- note something about how land doesn't vote

- proportion of democratic votes vs ks statistic, from two different starting plans
- look at least democratic district, sort by least to most (runs from 0.35 to 0.45% dem)
- produces CDF

colorado in context: congressional redistricting and competing fairness criteria in colorado

colorado laws requires more competitive districts - does that create more dem districts?
- governors race (weight factor 20)
- if you take number of competitive districts as independent variable, you'll get fewer democratic
  seats
- but if you take number of democratic seats as the independent variable, you'll have more
  competitive districts at lots and little number of seats

is it a gerrymander?
- no!
- looked at state treasurer race

colorado has open primaries! if your reg dem, you can only vote in dem, but if you're unaffiliated,
you can vote in either (one). they're mostly dem, but you can't tell from party registration <3

commissions
- selected through frankly bananas rules

congressional districts have to be equal to one (1) person
- ensembles can be not that, but you'd have to balance them
- but for colorado congressional, its 5%
- communities of interest: not political party! everyone who works at a mine, everyone who goes to a
  school, have to be able to draw it on a map and explain how laws would affect them
- political subdivisions: counties, towns, maybe school districts
- as compact as reasonably possible (undefined)
- maximize for politically competitive
- beth defined this in research
- cannot: protect any party, candidate, or incumbent: we've Outlawed Partisan Gerrymandering!

collapsed nodes
- small <10,000 people counties
- communities of interest

colorado independents
- you can run it on registration, but you shouldn't; you should focus on election outcomes due to
  the weirdness of party registration rules
